• picture this, a machine that could organize your cupboard just as you like it, or serve every member of the house a customized cup of coffee.
• makes your day easier, doesn't it?
• these are the products of artificial intelligence.
• but why use the term artificial intelligence?
• well, these machines are artificially incorporated with human-like intelligence to perform tasks as we do.
• this intelligence is built using complex algorithms and mathematical functions, but ai may not be as obvious as in the previous examples.
• in fact, ai is used in smartphones, cars, social media feeds, video games, banking, surveillance, and many other aspects of our daily life.
• the real question is, what does an ai do at its core?
• here is a robot we built in our lab, which is now dropped onto a field.
• in spite of a variation in lighting, landscape, and dimensions of the field, the ai robot must perform as expected.
• this ability to react appropriately to a new situation is called generalized learning.
• the robot is now at a crossroad, one that is paved, and the other, rocky.
• the robot must determine which path to take based on the circumstances.
• this portrays the robot's reasoning ability.
• here a short stroll, the robot now encounters a stream that it cannot swim across.
• using the plank provided as an input, the robot is able to cross this stream.
• so our robot uses the given input and finds the solution for a problem.
• these three capabilities make the robot artificially intelligent.
• in short, ai provides machines with the capability to adapt, reason, and provide solutions.
• well, now that we know what ai is, let's have a look at the two broad categories in ai's classified into.
• weak ai, also called narrow ai, focuses solely on one task.
• for example, alphago is a maestro of the game go, but you can't expect it to be even remotely good at chess.
• this makes alphago a weak ai.
• you might say alexa is definitely not a weak ai, since it can perform multiple tasks.
• when you ask alexa to play despacito, it picks up the key words play and despacito and runs a program it is trained to.
• alexa cannot respond to a question it isn't trained to answer.
• for instance, try asking alexa the status of traffic from work to home.
• alexa cannot provide you this information, as she is not trained to.
• and that brings us to our second category of ai, strong ai.
• now, this is much like the robots that only exist in fiction as of now.
• ultron from avengers is an ideal example of a strong ai.
• that's because it's self-aware and eventually even develops emotions.
• this makes the ai's response unpredictable.
• you must be wondering, well, how is artificial intelligence different from machine learning and deep learning?
• machine learning is a technique to achieve ai, and deep learning, in turn, is a subset of machine learning.
• machine learning provides a machine with the capability to learn from data and experience through algorithms.
• deep learning does this learning through ways inspired by the human brain.
• this means, through deep learning, data and patterns can be better perceived.
• ray kurzweil, a well-known futurist, predicts that by the year 2045, we would have robots as smart as humans.
• this is called the point of singularity.
• in fact, elon musk predicts that the human mind and body will be enhanced by ai implants, which would make us partly cyborgs.
• so, here's a question for you.
• which of the below ai projects don't exist yet?
• an ai robot with citizenship b.
• a robot with a muscular skeletal system c.
• ai that can read its owner's emotions d.
• ai that develops emotions over time give it a thought, and leave your answers in the comments section below.
• three lucky winners will receive amazon gift vouchers.
• since the human brain is still a mystery, it's no surprise that ai, too, has a lot of unventured domains.
• for now, ai is built to work with humans and make our tasks easier.
• however, with the maturation of technology, we can only wait and watch what the future of ai holds for us.
• well, that is artificial intelligence for you in short.
